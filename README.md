## Topic addressed by the project
[Games and Entertainment]
## Background
In my childhood, when there were no current smartphones, I often played this game: snake, from my mother’s phone. And I was always wondering how to create this game. And now, while I am learning programming languages, the first thing that occurred in my mind was to create this game and understand how it works.
## Aim of the project
Distract people from boring or stressful conditions. 

Motivate new programmers to further learn the programming language.
## Objectives of the project
This game leads to develop a huge game such as slither.io. But now, this is one of the basic levels of creating the big game.
During working on this project, I learned how to work with JavaFX. And it will help me with my future projects.

Update codes and make a good presentation.
